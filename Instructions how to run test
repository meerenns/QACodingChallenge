Dear fellow engineers,
By using python test framework, I wrote a test that makes sure that https://www.google.com/ is up.
I created a unittest that checks the availability of the google page, the file is called TestGetGoogle.py.
In order to run it successfully, make sure that you have installed Unittest and Requests packages.
You can run the test using the following command in terminal:
    python -m unittest -v
It has ‘OK’ as the last line of the output if the test passed and ‘FAILED’ otherwise.
